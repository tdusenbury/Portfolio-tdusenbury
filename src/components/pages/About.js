                <p className="">I make stuff. <br/>
                That simplifies it really. <br/>
                I can take pieces of fabric or long lengths of wool and make something completely different. <br/>
                I can make you a shirt or a blanket out of flannel.<br/> 
                I can make you a doll with a hand embroidered face or a pillow that only goes on "the good couch." <br/>
                If you are lucky, I will spend hours making a one-of-a-kind quilt for your child. <br/>
                I don't have a great skill: I have extreme patience and a desire to learn something new every single day.<br/>
                I hope to take the skills from my passion and join them with the skills of my previous careers and make something entirely new. <br/>
                I believe that my experience can manifest into an application in which the functions are intuitive and effective.
                <br/>
                Times may be tumultuous, but the world always surprises you. <br/>
                This year I celebrated a milestone birthday I was told I wouldn't see and will soon be watching my son accept his Eagle rank and graduate from high school. <br/>
                It truly is the journey that matters.</p>
